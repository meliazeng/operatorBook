Please provide the plot points for the chapter.  I need a plot outline or summary to write the chapter.  For example, you could give me information like:

* **Characters involved:** Who are the main characters in this chapter?
* **Setting:** Where and when does the chapter take place?
* **Conflict:** What is the central problem or challenge faced in this chapter?
* **Plot points:** What key events happen?  What choices do the characters make? What are the consequences?
* **Ending:** How does the chapter conclude?  What is the cliffhanger or resolution?


Once I have this information, I can write a compelling chapter for your novel.
